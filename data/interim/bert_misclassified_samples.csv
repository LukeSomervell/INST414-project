subject: effector 20.38: newsweek exposes telcos' secret lobbying campaign

* myspace and facebook plan to use personal data for
""targeted advertising""

personal data is a hot commodity. all sorts of businesses
trade in data concerning what we buy, how much credit we
have, where we live, what our interests are. this
information is sold to advertisers, who then eagerly use it
to more precisely target people whom they hope will be
interested in their products, leading to all of those
annoying catalogs that litter your doorstep, for example,
or the junk emails that choke your inbox every day.

luckily for the advertising industry, modern web users have
begun voluntarily providing all of their personal details
on social networking sites like facebook and myspace. users
of these sites happily upload all sorts of personal
information about what books and music they like, where
they shop, who their friends are, and where they live.
while users of these sites may imagine that they control
the information on their profile pages, advertisers are
salivating at the thought of all that personal data just
waiting to be processed, analyzed, and turned into profit.

recently, both facebook and myspace have announced plans to
do just that.

philippic: word of the day



































   the word of the day for february 11 is:




philippic   \\fuh-lip-ik\\    noun

     : a discourse or declamation full of bitter condemnation : tirade


example sentence:

     the columnist’s most recent philippic took the governor to task for her neglect of education reform in light of declining test scores throughout the state.


tutor.com is the world's #1 online tutoring company.  try it — free!

did you know?

     in 351 b.c., the greek orator demosthenes delivered a fiery speech warning his countrymen against the imperialistic designs of philip ii, king of macedon, and chastising them for their timidity and inaction. in greek, this and subsequent such speeches on the subject made by demosthenes were known as “philippikoi logoi,” literally, “speeches relating to philip.” demosthenes is known to have delivered only three philippics; in contrast, the philippics of the roman statesman marcus tullius cicero attacking marc antony some 300 years later — “orationes philippicae” in latin (so-named because of their similarity to demosthenes’ orations) — numbered fourteen. we still capitalize the word when we refer to these famous diatribes, but ever since 1592, “philippic” has been used (usually in lowercase) in a broader sense as well.


*indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

dear pdf converter customer,

how's this for a new year's resolution you can keep? it's 2008 and you're 
going to be better organized and have more time to do the things you love. 
how you ask? after all, you're inundated with invoices, contracts, e-mail 
attachments, spreadsheets - megabytes of electronic information. you're 
bombarded with stacks of bills, tax information, investment statements - 
you name it. the paperwork piles up both on your pc and around your desk. 
how can you possibly bring order to this mess of electronic documents and 
paper piles?

the answer: paperport professional 11. 

there's a reason why pc magazine awarded paperport its editors' choice. it 
simplifies things. it's the best tool available for taking all that 
clutter - the piles of paper, word files and spreadsheets, photos, pdf 
files, and more - and putting it all in one place into cleanly organized 
folders of indexed information that you can locate instantly. plus, 
paperport is designed with a drag-and-drop link to pdf converter, making 
document conversion a snap.

best of all, as a pdf converter customer, you can purchase paperport 
professional 11 for only $99.99* and save $100 off the regular price.

imagine all your paper and digital documents indexed, searchable, and 
available to you at the click of a button - and all you need to do is drag 
your documents or photos to an e-mail icon at the bottom of your desktop 
to instantly share them with anyone, anywhere, anytime. 

here's more about what makes paperport professional 11 so special...

* fast, perfect scans from your all-in-one or scanner - every time!
  if you've ever scanned a document, there's a strong likelihood it didn't 
  come out exactly the way wanted requiring you to re-scan it. more likely 
  it needed enhancement your scanner doesn't provide. paperport 
  professional 11 gives you set (scanner enhancement technology) tools to 
  correct your scans. paperport's customizable scanning profiles let you 
  automate your corrections. simply use one of the five included profiles 
  or create your own custom profile. auto-straighten, auto-enhance, 
  auto-crop and more. one click and you get perfect scans the first time. 
  every time. 

* a better way to organize documents and photos on your desktop
  paperport along with pdf converter provides a complete end-to-end 
  document solution for scanning, converting, organizing, assembling and 
  sharing your documents like never before. paperport professional 11 goes 
  further than microsoft windows by uniquely organizing all of your 
  scanned documents, photos, and over 150 document formats, as large, 
  clear thumbnail images on your paperport desktop. this allows you to 
  quickly find the files you're looking for based not only on their name 
  but also by their appearance. 

* find files faster - never misplace another document
  paperport's all-in-one search is our most powerful search engine yet. it 
  uses nuance's advanced ocr technology (now 40% more accurate) and lets 
  you easily find scanned paper, pdf documents and even digital 
  photographs anywhere on your local pc or network. the all-in-one search 
  goes beyond traditional search technology and enables users to quickly 
  search the content of scanned documents, keywords and annotations. 

* the smartest paperport ever
  our new intelligent search agent paperport watson expands your search 
  universe far beyond the all-in-one search. it searches web sites, 
  e-mails, news sites, blogs, shopping sites, and works with msn, google, 
  and x1 search utilities to automatically find a wealth of information 
  that is delivered to you in a flexible sidebar that docks to your 
  paperport desktop. it's perfect for doing research and collecting 
  relevant search results into a paperport folder to organize and combine. 

* assemble documents from any format
  paperport's famous document thumbnails, page thumbnails and 
  revolutionary split desktop provide superior document assembly 
  functionality so you can pull apart, reorder pages and merge all your 
  documents into new pdf documents just as you do with real paper. by 
  simply dragging and dropping, you can combine scanned documents with 
  pages from pc applications, including microsoft word, excel and 
  powerpoint, to create custom pdf documents. with paperport 11, working 
  with electronic documents is as easy as stacking paper. 

we think the features mentioned above are well worth the special, 
limited-time $99.99 purchase price. but there's actually more. 
paperport professional 11 also provides you with:
              
   * new how-to-guides to walk you through program features 
   * new capture assistant to better manage multi-page and two-sided 
     documents 
   * new folder notes allow you to attach meaningful information to any 
     folder for reference 
   * new subject, author and keywords (metadata) can be automatically 
     added to every scan 
   * updated desktopdelivery with auto-keywords and indexing

 top 5 uses
======================================================================

    1. hassle-free expense reports - simply scan all your 
       receipts to one central location associated with your 
       trip or project. when submitting your expense report, 
       simply print them out or attach as a pdf.
                        
    2. e-mail instead of fax - creating and sharing pdf 
       files is as simple as drag-and-drop. when you e-mail 
       instead of fax, you ensure that your document won't get 
       lost or be viewed by someone else. plus the quality is 
       better and you can forget all about busy signals.
                        
    3. create fillable electronic forms from paper ones - 
       next time someone faxes you a form to fill out, let 
       paperport do the heavy lifting by recognizing form 
       fields so you can quickly type it out.
                        
    4. organize your family photos - paperport makes it a 
       breeze. use keywords to find specific family members or 
       events. file photos by year. scrapbooking has never been 
       easier.
                        
    5. combine multiple documents into one - you need to 
       combine a report, a spreadsheet, some photos, two web 
       pages, and a trade magazine article into a single 
       document for the sake of ease. paperport lets you create 
       a single pdf of these various files regardless of size, 
       shape, or format.

"i am robert taylor, director at kleinwort benson private bank, the private banking arm of dresdner bank, which in turn, is a subsidiary of german insurance giant allianz. i am contacting you concerning a deceased customer, and an investment he placed under our banks management 3years ago. i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.

i contact you independently and no one is informed of this communication. i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you. in 2005, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.7 million british pounds sterling, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. i was the officer assigned to his case, i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.

we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation. in january 2007, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments. he directed that i liquidate the funds and have it deposited with a security firm. i informed him that kleinwort benson private bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done. i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. large cash movements have become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. i contacted my affiliate and had the funds available as he had requested. i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with a security consultancy firm. this security firm is an especially private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to
this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. in line with instructions, the money was deposited with them. he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week. this was the last communication we had; this transpired around 25th february 2007.

in october last year, we got a call from the security company informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned, given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security company, and i could not understand why our client had not come forward to claim his deposit. i made futile efforts to locate him.

i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department. four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our man was dead. a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne, south of france. we were soon enough able to confirm all of this including cause of death. the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and 
also to come forward to claim his estate.

if you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. in his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. in the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.

this bank even gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; our now deceased client died in testate. in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we 
instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem.

it is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. it is quite clear now that our dear fellow died with no known or identifiable family members. this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.

according to practice, the security company will by the end of this year broadcast a request for statements of claim to kleinwort benson private bank failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit to kleinwort benson private bank. this will result in the money entering the kleinwort benson private bank accounting system and the portfolio will 
be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. this will not happen if i
have my way.

what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something. it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who sit upon certain chairs and oversee certain portfolios. you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose. there is 8,700,000.00 deposited in a security company. i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so.

i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as kleinwort benson private bank is concerned, the transaction with the late customer concluded when i sent the funds to the security company all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. the security company has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit. they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that i may direct. this is the situation.

this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. the investigation has come to an end. my proposal; i am prepared to instruct the security company to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. upon receipt of the deposit, i am prepared to share the money with you in half. that is: i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. we share the proceeds 50/50. you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim.

i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days. i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to our late client. i will then officially communicate with the security company and instruct them to release the deposit to you. with these two things: all is done. the alternative would be for us to have the security company direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money directly from the security company as it is not a conventional financial institution; they accept deposits from only organizations thus; what you hand over to them is what you get back. they do not have the means to process the money.

we can fine-tune this based on our interactions. i am aware of the consequences of this proposal. i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget i ever contacted you. do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. you may not know this but people like myself who have made a  
tidy sum out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector.

i am not a criminal and what i do, i do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move. such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. i cannot let this chance pass me by. for once i find myself in total control of my destiny. this chance wont pass me by.

i ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.

i am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. lets share the blessing. if you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this email. if you give me positive signals, i will give you the relevant details and initiate this process towards a conclusion.

i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; i will deny knowing you and about this project. i repeat, i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account. contact me only through my alternate email account: rtaylorrrr@hotmail.co.uk

i do not want any direct link between you and i. my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy. please observe this instruction religiously.

please, again, note i am a family man; i have a wife and children. i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients. do not betray my confidence. i await your response.

sincerely,
robert taylor

http://blogs.sun.com/gullfoss/entry/seasons_with_sponsored_open_source


openoffice.org and staroffice at cebit 2008
===========================================
""i'll attend this year's cebit 2008 trade fair in hannover, germany
from march 4th to march 9th.
if you like to visit our openoffice.org booth then please come to the
""business solutions park"" in hall 5, e57.

this trade fair event at cebit 2008 is planned by openoffice.org
deutschland e.v. and there are following exhibitors: openoffice.org
deutschland e.v., scai, o³spaces, mobility office solutions ag and

""the openoffice.org developer's guide is now available online in the

success stories
#########################################################################

26,000 linux boxes in education in the philippines
==================================================
if i understood this spanish article correctly, the government in the
philippines has already deployed 13,000 linux computers in education and
will now add another 10,000 boxes with ubuntu software preloaded. it does
  not say explicitly, but i guess most of these boxes will run
openoffice.org as well.

http://blogs.sun.com/dancer/entry/26_000_linux_boxes_in


about openoffice.org usage in india
===================================
""coming to open source on the desktop, while desktop linux remains
kludgy, openoffice.org is doing just fine. various estimates put
it at anything between 10 and 20% of the market. i think that usage
is higher. in india, at least, many large organizations have put
the bulk of their users on openoffice restricting microsoft office
to a handful of people who interact with the outside world.""

http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20080211/edit01.shtml


dutch ""government isv"" adds odf support
=======================================
if i understood this dutch article correctly, the dutch isv centric,
which seems to very active in the public sector, is adding odf
support to their applications. apparently the adoption of odf by the
city of heerenveen and the city of groningen had some impact on the
decision.

http://blogs.sun.com/dancer/entry/dutch_government_isv_adds_odf


government offers computer software for 2 euro
==============================================
""the scheme offers staroffice 8 sun microsystems software, which
includes starwriter (word-processor), starcalc (spreadsheet),
starimpress (digital presentation), stardraw (for painting) and
starbase (database).

students, teachers and disabled persons may register for the software
by downloading the application forms from www.thesmartisland. gov.mt.
these will be accepted until 11 april.""

http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080214/local/government-to-help-families-buy-new-computers


users demand support for openoffice.org
=======================================
i just came across the following announcement which clearly shows the
strong momentum around openoffice.org, i.e. user demand is driving
vendor support for openoffice.org:

""qualitylogic (www.qualitylogic.com), a provider of leading-edge qa and
qc test tools and services for the imaging and telecom industries, has
released test files for the first of several planned applications found
in openoffice.org 2. test files are now available for ""writer"" and 
""draw."" ""impress"" is in development, and additional applications
are planned.

qualitylogic has been developing test files for popular windows
applications for over 20 years. these files are used by printer
companies to ensure compatibility between their printers and the
applications their customers use, and by software companies whose
applications convert one file format to another. they are also used by
fortune 1000, government, education and healthcare companies to help
make printer and software purchasing decisions. the popularity of the
openoffice.org office suite has created a need within these companies
for sophisticated test files similar to those qualitylogic has
developed for windows applications.""

openoffice.org on cnet tv
=========================
openoffice.org is being mentioned as the top download of 2007 in this
cnet tv video. really cool!

http://www.cnettv.com/9742-1_53-32195.html


openoffice.org runs on olpc
===========================
great news from j. david eisenberg! he just successfully tested
openoffice.org on an olpc.

http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odf-adoption/200802/msg00002.html


new startcenter replaces startmodule
====================================
""after a hectic week of discussion, implementation and rewriting we now
have a new initial window when you start openoffice.org without a
document. this up to now brought up a large window (so large because it
defines the size of the document that will replace it) in ""battleship gray""
as some call it. on most platforms you don't see this window so often,
because system integration will usually leave you with an application
window (writer, impress, calc, ...) instead. on mac however the so
called startmodule is the norm rather than the exception. so we put a
long planned overhaul of the startmodule in motion. the first plan was
to use a dialog replacing the startmodule, however that would lead to
questions about modality, startup and exit behavior due to the modal
event loop and similar issues.

so in the end we decided to improve the existing startmodule instead,
turning it into the new startcenter. the startcenter contains a host
of labeled buttons (natively themed where available of course) that
allow the user to create a new document or open an existing one.
it also shows the same menu entries as before, so additional features
like the recent file list are still available.""

http://blogs.sun.com/gullfoss/entry/new_startcenter_replaces_startmodule


openoffice.org at fosdem 2008
=============================
""like jurgen schmidt and luis suarez potts (but other agreed), my
conclusion about fosdem is simple: fosdem is the place for
openoffice.org developers, and i strongly invite people to join
next year, for fosdem2009. openoffice.org project must be preent to
answer questions.

last but not least, mainly two sort of people attend: some are students,
and don't know well the project. other have high level skills, and are
profesional of code ( but do not represent the majority).""

http://eric.bachard.free.fr/news/2008/02/some-words-about-fosdem-2008.html

""the only sad thing: i never had time to actually attend any of the
talks and sessions i wanted to go to. instead, i met many i had wanted
to meet up with and otherwise helped out sophie g. and leon m. at the
stand. my thanks to them: they set up and manned the booth all day
saturday and, in sophia's case, sunday. we gave out hundreds of
brochures frank p. and stella had created (and jürgen had printed up)
and probably over a hundred t-shirts. and we could have given away many
times more that number, i am sure, as our devroom was in the aw
building, and not the obvious main building, where the food was and
mozilla was.""

tips & tricks
#########################################################################

impressive eye candy: 3d opengl transitions
===========================================
""powerpoint's old push-down transition has done its 15 years of service,
and it's time for it to retire. do the sleepy faces in your meetings
agree? openoffice.org impress 2.4 has the answer in the form ten 3d
opengl-rendered transitions:

     * flipping tiles
     * outside turning cube
     * revolving circles
     * turning helix
     * inside turning cube
     * fall
     * turn around
     * iris
     * turn down
     * rochade""

http://www.oooninja.com/2008/02/eye-candy-3d-opengl-transitions-impress.html


pdf/a support in openoffice.org
===============================
the first release candidate for openoffice.org 2.4 has just been
release. one of the key new features is the built-in pdf/a export
capability. the new chart features are very cool as well! please
check if the release candidate is good enough for being promoted
to a final version!

http://blogs.sun.com/dancer/entry/pdf_a_support_in_openoffice


table2clipboard firefox extension
=================================
""make copying tables from web pages to offline office apps easier with
table2clipboard, a free firefox extension. the low-key app simply adds
a single item to the edit and right-click context menus, ""copy whole 
table,"" that retains a table's formatting and makes it far easier to
paste and manipulate in microsoft word or excel, openoffice.org and
other programs.""

http://www.lifehacker.com.au/tips/2008/02/15/copy_tables_and_keep_their_formatting_with_table2clipboard-2.html


links about the usage of mysql with openoffice.org
==================================================
""here is what i have found so far:

* mysql meets openoffice.org
* connect openoffice.org to mysql
* database specific problems
* connect mysql and base
* connect to mysql in openoffice.org

with respect to potentially using mysql as an alternative to microsoft 
access,
people might find the following links useful, too:

* migrating from microsoft sql server and access to mysql
* access to mysql
* migrating a microsoft access application to mysql using
   activegrid studio
* building a java desktop database application
* connecting to a mysql database in netbeans ide
* connecting a gui to a java db database with netbeans ide
* creating a simple web application in netbeans ide using mysql
* dbforms from ms access to php + mysql""

http://blogs.sun.com/dancer/entry/links_about_the_usage_of


solveig talks about sumif function
==================================
""you want to add up all the items that are in one particular category
since you want to know how much you're spending on music festivals; how
much on climbing related purchases; etc. but the items are entered like
this. not really well categorized. ... if you'd like to play with the
spreadsheet, here it is. right-click on the link and choose to save it
to your computer.""

http://openoffice.blogs.com/openoffice/2008/02/a-nice-little-c.html


openoffice.org 3.0 and cooperation with the redflag 2000 framework team
=======================================================================
""today i want to give you a new overview on what features and
enhancements we are working on in cooperation with the redflag 2000
framework team.

we enhanced the “change icon” dialog again to enable user to import
images more easily. currently users have to scale their images to the
two supported icon sizes (16x16 for small icons and 26x26 pixel for
large icons) before they can import these images. although this solution
enables users to use their own tool set to scale images it sets a high
hurdle for others. sometimes users just want to import images and use
them as quick as possible. the new import images implementation now
automatically scales images, while preserving their aspect ratio.

the next picture gives you an impression how the new scaling
implementation works.""

http://blogs.sun.com/gullfoss/entry/openoffice_org_3_0_and


intermediate openoffice.org api plugin for netbeans 6

=====================================================
""we still have one little issue that is no real error but it is
definitely not nice. but the plugin works and is completely functional
and because of many requests we decided to provide an intermediate
version 1.1.1 on api.openoffice.org.""

http://blogs.sun.com/gullfoss/entry/intermediate_openoffice_org_api_plugin


built-in svg import
===================
""two weeks ago, i had the privilege to work on a fun project using
company time - it was novell hackweek again. so i teamed up with
friend & colleague fridrich to finally get ooo its long-deserved
built-in svg import - in fact, this is the most voted-for feature of
the whole project.""

"human suffering in somalia
==========================
devastating footage from somalia will be somewhere near the top of our programme tonight. i think probably the lead. the place persists in being far too dangerous for any outsider to risk visiting but one journalist has been able to supply the most harrowing account of human suffering. it's very clear that the american-backed ethiopian invasion and the attempt to install the western-backed government that had been holed up in baidoa has proved a failure and the internecine warfare is as bad as at any time. the one period of order, the six months during which the islamic courts movement held power with some considerable popular support, is now far behind. the ethiopians are effectively trapped with long supply lines only sustained with us support.

it is one of these tragedies where the west has interfered, supposedly with high intent designed to prevent radical anti-western elements taking root and has again misjudged the scale of the crisis confronting it. and what we have tonight is very dramatic footage of what, for most of the people living there is everyday life in mogadishu: dead soldiers on the street; gunfire everywhere; tanks; injured civilians and general human misery. the question is whether britain and italy, once the colonial powers, can bring any influence to bear on those who never were to rethink what they are doing. the failed state continues to fail.

brown takes a beating
=====================
back here there has been the usual farmyard noises on the floor of the house of commons as government and opposition try to claw political advantage from the pre-budget statement. the tories are enraged at what they see as the theft of their ideas while labour preens itself for once again lifting the ideas of others to pursue their idiosyncratic third way. prime minister's question time saw the prime minister himself getting a bit of a drubbing.

wildcat strikes by postal workers
=================================
the postal strike staggers from disaster to catastrophe. it is beginning to have the feel of the miner's strike, decent men and women caught up in a kind of march to the jobs graveyard in the face of a crying need to change the way the whole thing functions. and is there a deeper plot afoot perhaps to make privatizations an inevitability?

chinese cyber police in action 
==============================
the chinese reckon they know a thing or two about workers. they are having their communist party congress this week and lindsey hilsum is looking at the fine-tuned controls and repression that ensure dissident views never go too far. she will be introducing us to the cyber police who pop up on your screen when you dare to try to access some site of which they do not approve. inevitably this mythic figure refers you to 'the authorities'.

racing trial
============
a lot of fascinating court cases are in being, the kieren fallon case tells us more about the way in which the alleged race-fixing plot was uncovered. there is a new trial of men accused of running english terrorist training camps and then there is the shed, the wife, the mistress and the fire. today it seems it may be the turn of the mistress.

the big frieze
==============
and finally, nicholas glass has gone to regent's park to the giant frieze exhibition. i'm not sure what he is going to find there but i don't suppose the artists who made the stuff know either.

race-car dodging 'roo
=====================
while i'm at it, don't miss the kangaroo tonight. amazingly, this jumping marsupial finds its way onto a motor race circuit and hops along at about 50mph, weaving in and out of the speeding cars and lives, if not to tell the tale, certainly to wag it.

 this is going to sound weird but i was never really embarrassed of my penis size in front of my wife. however, i always wished that i was bigger and i was embarrassed of my size when i was in the locker room. i felt that guys would look at me and secretly make fun of me. with axherbal i have gained 1.5 inches and appear quite thick when flaccid. i am no longer embarrassed in the locker room and i feel that i am a solid size now. my wife also loves my new size. p.j. holly, mi

"turkey okays iraq incursions
==================== 

well, if one was able to discuss hitting the fan, tonight might be the beginning of it. 

because the nato member state turkey has just voted to allow its troops to go into northern iraq in hot pursuit of kurds that they perceive to be part of the insurrection inside their own country. and this is trouble. 

as defence secretary bob gates told this programme last week america war effort is almost entirely dependent upon being able to use turkey as a transhipment point. the turks have always been apprehensive about the increasingly independent kurdish state in the north of iraq, for fear that the infection of statehood would cross the border and pollute their own large kurdish population. 

the great kurdish diaspora which traverses at least four states in the region - turkey, iraq, iran, and syria is akin to the yearnings of zionist of yesteryear for a jewish homeland. hence the delicacy of what is happening right now. 

the matter is shivering the bush administration's timbers and is of course beginning to define the new islamic president of turkey. it's yet another consequence of the war in iraq and its capacity to send shockwaves through the region. but then it was former defence under-secretary paul wolfowitz who talked of throwing the pieces in the middle east up into the air in the knowledge that they could not come down and land in a worse position than they already were. 

nick paton walsh is on the case - a man who knows a thing or two about large states that live in fear of their ethnic minorities.

china fumes over dalai lama's gold
================================ 

the dalai's lama's embrace of a congressional gold medal and of the american president in the white house has scandalised china which is so angry that they're not going to do anything about it. 

it's an intriguing question as to whether the olympics will represent the tibetans' last hurrah. for if this chinese stranglehold over tibet survives the olympics, as it surely will - it's hard to see when a better opportunity for international focus will ever arise. sarah smith is on the case in washington and lindsey hilsum reports from the chinese view.

3,000 jobs to go at bbc
=====================

the bbc's going through some awkward tensions. the unions have been told to expect nearly 3000 redundancies. though there is little mention of any sackings amongst the hoards of middle managers that the corporation is reputed to have. you wouldn't have thought they had so much middle to manage.

benjamin cohen is reporting for us - and examining why the bbc feels the need to make these cuts whilst still investing in new services which have yet to attract the viewers, listeners and users tuning to in bbc 1 and 2,  and the five main radio services. his report at 7 on 4. 


live interview with martin amis
===========================

finally, the great empire stirs. yes britannia rules the waves once again - even if all she's doing is waving above a frozen sea. she's going to stake a claim to large junks of the south atlantic and antarctic ocean for the purposes of the exploitation of gas and oil. 

however she's going to behave particularly decently in not actually exercising her claim preferring instead to stand by the antarctic treaty which forbids such activity. tom clarke is just going outside to compile his report - he may be some time.

"'thrifty genes' blamed as obesity rivals hunger

* under the microscope:* there are now more overweight people than hungry
people in rapidly developing countries. this rather surprising fact is
reported by barry m popkin in the september 2007 issue of * scientific
american,* writes * prof william reville*


as a consequence, obesity is a more serious health risk than hunger in most
of these nations. traditionally, under-nutrition was a serious health risk
in these countries, but a dramatic change driven by globalisation has
occurred over the past 20 years.

popkin reports that in countries such as egypt, south africa and mexico more
than half the adults are either overweight or obese. these weight categories
are defined by body mass index (bmi). bmi is calculated as your body weight
in kilos divided by the square of your height in metres. a bmi of 25 to 29
is defined as overweight and a bmi of 30 and above as obese. these criteria
are very strict at the lower limits - for example someone with a bmi of 26
will scarcely look overweight and, so, the obesity statistics quoted above
may not be quite as alarming as they seem. nevertheless it is clear that a
serious problem exists, and it is growing. obesity correlates with diabetes,
heart disease and other illnesses and a public health crisis is threatened
for these economies.

popkin homes in on mexico as a specific example. fewer than 10 per cent of
mexicans were overweight in 1989, but surveys in 2006 showed that 71 per
cent of mexican women and 66 per cent of men were overweight or obese (these
figures rival the figures in the us). in 1989, diabetes was very rare in
mexico but today almost one seventh of the population suffers from
adult-onset (type two) diabetes and diabetes is spreading fast.

over the past 20 years, living styles have changed dramatically in countries
such as india, mexico, china and the philippines. supermarket chains have
spread to those regions and as average incomes rise poorer people have
adopted dietary and exercise habits that lead to obesity - consuming sugary
soft drinks and foods, watching tv, riding motorbikes instead of walking,
and buying convenient processed foods from supermarkets.

people are now consuming much more energy-dense food such as vegetable oils
and food derived from animals (meat, fish, eggs and dairy products). the
combination of a more sedentary lifestyle and high-calorie food intake has
precipitated an obesity problem that is concentrated in the poorest sections
of these societies where access to education that would promote healthy
eating and exercise is severely limited.

popkin describes the interesting hypothesis that obese people in these
countries may be more susceptible to developing diabetes or high blood
pressure than obese people in the developed world. the argument is that
populations in latin america, africa and south east asia carry a
disproportionate number of ""thrifty genes"" that evolution selected in order
to help survival during famines by enabling people to store fat more
efficiently in times of plenty. unfortunately when high calorie food becomes
freely available, a person with these genes efficiently accumulates fat
around the heart and liver, increasing the risk of diabetes and heart
disease. popkin reports that nearly one third of people in china, where
obesity is sharply increasing, suffer from high blood pressure.

people in these regions are rapidly switching from their traditional
low-fat, high-fibre diets to calorie-rich fats, sweeteners and refined
carbohydrates. one of the biggest contributors to obesity is the sweetened
beverage. over most of our evolutionary history, after weaning, the only
beverages we took were breast milk, and water. water has no calories and we
never evolved mechanisms to automatically reduce food intake to compensate
for beverage consumption. up to 50 years ago the average proportion of
dietary calories contributed by beverages was small but this is no longer
the case as sugary soft drinks have spread everywhere on earth. the average
mexican now consumes more soft drinks than the average us citizen.

other key contributors to obesity are energy-dense foods such as vegetable
oils, meat, fish, eggs and milk. technological advances and government
subsidies in the production of oilseeds have made vegetable oils cheap. and
most of the growth of the world production of meat, fish and dairy produce
has come from these nations and this is injecting excessive amounts of
saturated fat into the average diet thereby greatly increasing the risk of
cardiovascular disease.

globalisation means the free movement of capital, technology, goods and
services around the world and is the main driver of the changes in diet and
lifestyle described in this article. of course globalisation also confers
benefits on many of these countries such as encouragement of trade,
introduction of technology, improvement in employment, and so on, but
unfortunately there are many negative effects such as the obesity problems
described in this article. remedial measures must be put in place to reverse
these negative effects.

unless strong preventive policies are implemented the medical costs of
obesity-related illness could topple the economies of china, india and other
rapidly developing countries. china already spends six per cent of its gdp
on nutrition-related chronic diseases. popkin suggests restructuring the
huge agricultural subsidies that encourage the production of meat and dairy
products, thereby encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables. new
policies should also promote the consumption of more whole grains, with
their enhanced fibre, vitamins and minerals, as opposed to refined
carbohydrates. taxes should be imposed on caloric sweeteners in order to
discourage their consumption.

and the author and stalin expert simon sebag montefiore gives us a
personal view of the writer alexander solzhenitsyn on the day the iconic
writer was laid to rest.  

and finally my thanks to newsnight viewer shilpa for this joke (almost) fit for an eleven year old: 
a man was in court for a double murder and the judge said: 'you are
charged with beating your wife to death with a spanner.' 
a voice at the back of the courtroom yelled out: 'you *******!'
the judge continued: 'you are also charged with beating your daughter to
death with a spanner.'
again the voice at the back of the courtroom yelled out: 'you *******
*******!!!'
the judge stopped, looked at the man in the back of the court room, and
said: 'sir, i can understand your anger and frustration at this crime,
but i will not have any more of these outbursts from you or i shall
charge you with contempt! now what is the problem?'
the man at the back of the court stood up and responded: 'for 15 years
i've lived next door to the accused and every time i asked to borrow a
******* spanner, he said he didn't have one!

"aftermath of pakistan bomb blast  
================================
the aftermath of the catastrophic assault on benazir bhutto�s convoy last night continues. bhutto�s people suspect the dark forces of pakistan�s intelligence service, general musharraf prefers to blame other of his political enemies. jonathan rugman is on the ground in karachi and we�ll have a full account from him at 7.

serious fraud office may look at gmtv phone fraud 
=================================================
when is a fraud not a fraud? when, it seems, a broadcaster is involved and the regulator doesn't want the matter to be pursued further.

after we and others were told yesterday that the police saw no public interest in investigating the multi-million pound phone-in scams revealed by itv, gmtv, channel 4 and the bbc, today we learn that the serious fraud office may get involved. but only if the media regulator ofcom asks them to. the sfo says it will look at documents if ofcom wants to send them over, but it's not yet reviewing this case, let alone investigating. all very difficult to comprehend, especially when cabinet minister peter hain describes what happened at itv as ''almost daylight robbery"" and called for those responsible at itv to be ""nailed"". one view is that it would constitute 'double jeopardy' if a broadcaster could be fined by a regulator and then subsequently face criminal action. the fine should be punishment enough. another view - the men and women in blue don't fancy what would be a complicated investigation that could end up being very difficult to prove in court. make your own judgement when you see our report tonight.

"dear friends and board,

i hope this finds you and your families well.

1. my family is ok.  even my mother at 86 says shes fine.  i know we are blessed.  but frankly im stressed. im stressed about war  as i often am - and my familys colds and my job.  this feeling of stress will pass.  these feelings are just what i have until the next feelings come.

what we are, is something different.  

we are reconciling beings.  we are always stumbling our way home, as we combat vets call it.  

this is like sitting, invited, in a chicken house raised on stilts above a rice field with an old woman.  the old woman tells you her story of war.  you both cry.  you look at the rice field and hear the slight breeze in the rice stalks.

wu men (1183-1260) said,

moon and clouds are the same
mountain and valley are different;
all are blessed; all are blessed.
is this one?  is this two?

the work is reconciliation in as loving a way as we can do it at any given time, knowing how fallible we are.  the work is also laughter because of this fallibility  and forgiveness.  

the means for jhai of this work is primarily our work with computers (which are tools) that accord with villagers own senses of needs.  to make these tools useful requires highest respect and the use of solid business and community organizing techniques.

2. i said this time i would share with you the names of the people who have worked on the jhaipc and systems project since 2002.  i will do that at the end.  if your name is missing, let me know and i will add it next time.  jhais board and i are very, very grateful to all of you for your excellent work.  

we are now preparing for a field test in laos in a hmong village school (the only way in is three hours by boat from the nearest road) and in a riverside village in the south of laos.  we will do this very soon and will announce when we do it, not before.  we expect other field tests to follow shortly thereafter in other countries whose names i will announce as funding is fully in place.  

	we expect to use and document our jhai systems /reconciliation method of training for sustainability in laos.  this is our proven method in lao schools.  we first provided this kind of training in 2001.  
	we also expect to test jhai networks, our new communication suite in laos, but the date is not determined.  
	finally, we will set up on a hub/spoke, village server (jhai pc)/clients (novatium clients) basis, with a lead application being telemedicine via the neurosynaptic remedi telemedicine hardware and software.  

this has taken a long time:  over five years.   this is because 
	it is very hard to do this, 
	we have run out of money more than once, and 
	we have worked almost always with volunteers who through good will have aided us.  

please understand that it is still the case that a very, very small percentage of any computer-aided implementations  of any sort  anywhere  are being done on a financially sustainable basis.  using our method we believe all can do this.  i am very confident about this.

sustainability is key.  without it implementers are raising expectations in an imperial way and are creating junk.  this is reality.

3.  we expect to do our first curriculum development training with world links in vientiane the last week of this month/first week of november.  my jhai colleague, vorasone dengkayaphichith, has obtained all necessary permissions and these trainings are co-sponsored by the lao pdr ministry of education.  

4.  the jhai coffee cooperative is doing very well.  to order café lao please go to: http://store.thanksgivingcoffee.com/vfp and support both veterans for peace and jhai through the kindness of thanksgiving coffee.

5.  in the past weeks 
	i was honored to present in both ethiopia and the philippines.  i am following up with many people, including people from ghana, ethiopia, tanzania, india, zimbabwe, cambodia, philippines, vietnam and lao pdr.  
	we are working out a partnership with the ghana-india centre for excellence in ict.  i have spent the last days working with an excellent engineer there.
	since my last update we have upgraded our hardware via a kind gift from via systems and know our ubuntu software is fully operational on flash memory.  i will announce the full specs of our equipment as we open our first field test and not before, except to partners.  
	at the conferences i focused on sustainability which is our core competence.

5.  ive been asked more than once, lee, how do you folks do this with so little money?  olpc, for example, has raised $20 million.  youve raised about $250,000 for the jhaipc project over five years.  whatsup with that?

my answer is that i wish i had more money, but i dont.  who wouldnt?  ive been dirt poor, homeless and hungry.  this situation is easy compared to that.  i know whom i am working for:  people.  jhais edge is that we actually build on conversations with villagers.  we impose nothing.  we meet people as fallible people.

all i can do is thank you and those we serve.  i do this because im a part of this huge family here on earth and were screwed if we dont get together.  i may be american but im not george w. bush.  i know our job is to reconcile, not to kill each other or to make just some of us obscenely rich.  i also know that if we work together we can succeed.  ive seen it in belfast.  ive seen it during the civil rights movement in the us and with veterans working for peace.  i see it when disabled people get together.  and ive seen it in my own family  and with you.

so im feeling a bit emotional today and i hope that is alright with you.  ive written my way out of my funk and i hope ive informed you well enough about where jhai is.  

please join us with a gift of time and/or money ... or just tell me your story.  i love stories.  send a check to the address below or contact me.  you can also use paypal through our website.

the folks listed below the salutation helped form the jhai story by their fine work.  they deserve our thanks.

heres rumi:

all day and night, music,
a quiet, bright
reedsong.  if it 
fades, we fade.

lets dance!

people who helped build the jhai pc and system (partial list)  

jhaipc 1.0 (2002-2004)

	lee felsenstein drew the initial design on the back of a napkin in july 2002.
	mark cohen did the final programming for our lao field test.
	steve okay did the vast majority of the work on the initial linux kernel under debian.
	vorasone dengkayaphichith and his staff organized the set up of the first and second tries at implementation in laos.
	anousak souphavanh wrote laonux, helped set up the field test, and later translated open office into lao language.
and jonathan jamison, ping lam, andrea longo, adam marks, bob marsh, stan osborne, mark summer, michael sundius, wai yip tung, michael wakabayashi, scott yokum, babbs cowan, ed gaible, and janine firpo worked on the project among others.  
funding for this phase came from idrc, world bank (ifc), sida, us state department, and smaller foundations and many individuals.

jhaipc1.6 (2004-2006)

	chris larsen and staff and rex vance were instrumental in every way as they worked for the window rock school district on the navajo reservation during this effort.
	jim stockford wrangled the engineers (and me) and worked hard on power supply.  
	stan osborne worked at critical junctures on integration.
	gerard cerchio did most of the new programming and the uml and coordinated software development.
and eduardo cervantes, alex rudis, john sherry, peter tavenise, jim forster and lee felsenstein (again, especially on power supply), among others.  this version and even an assembly doc are open source and open design and can be found on sourceforge.

funding for this phase came primarily from cisco foundation with some funding from intel, soros foundation/ideas fund, smaller foundations and many individuals.

jhai pc2.0 and system (2006-present)

richard brown, ashok jhunjhunwala (host), damodharan at iit-madras/tenet and his crew, jaya kumar, sameer sawarkar (ceo, neurosynaptic), alok singh (ceo, novatium), ravi gopalan (ceo, argusoft), nisheeth mishra, stan osborne (again), jim stockford (again), vorasone dengkayaphichith (always), anousak souphavanh (again), andy graef, jeff fohl, jim ogata, kushant uppal, marco figueiredo, shirley akasreku, sr (ram) reddy, wayne wilson, jesse thorn 

funding for this phase has come primarily from an inkind donation by iit-madras via the good offices of dr. ashok jhunjhunwala and the ghana-india centre for excellence in ict via the good offices of dorothy gordon, director general, as well as individual donors including my family.

we are grateful to all.

recently signed up for the listserve. since i am new to this many of you  probably 
already know about this resource but, just in case some do not, i will  pass 
it on. the covertheuninsured.org weekly news digest is a compilation  of news 
stories, editorials and opinion pieces from newspapers around the  country 
which is sent electronically.  it is free and an easy way to  help one keep 
abreast of healthcare coverage happenings. i find it a very  useful of keeping

"badgers: 'tb threat to cattle'
======================

if you're a badger look away now. 

the uk's chief scientists has called high noon for badgers - he claims that those shuffling denizens of the night are a threat to the nations' bovines, as they could spread tb to the cattle herds of britain. 

defra has said it welcomed sir david king's report and would be considering how to respond - there are some 300,000 badgers and the incidence of tb in them rose by 18 per cent last year. more tonight at seven on four.


pkk to sign a ceasefire?
==================== 
 
peace in our time or perhaps more precisely pkk in our time. it looks like these 'plucky mountain warriors', or to use others' terminology 'terrorists', have thrown in the towel. having scythed their way through the turkish armed forces in the last few weeks killing 12 at a time and provoking the potential of the most appalling turkish reprisals - we are told they are going to declare a ceasefire tonight. 
 
they seem to have done the kurdish cause a profound disservice but tonight we shall try to unravel what they're all about and how close to regional war turkey came. we'll be talking to the redoubtable historian norman stone now resident in ankara, and nick paton walsh will be putting the pieces together at this end. 
 
q&a: why might turkey attack iraq?

polish liberals voted in
============================
 
the terrible twins have been divided. one remains president of poland the other is now the ex-pm of poland. the incoming government courtesy of yesterday's general election is pledged to revolutionise the country's relationship with the outside world - the troops come home from iraq; europe is engaged - the economy will be rebooted thus potentially stemming the flow of refugees and conceivably encouraging some to go home. so if you need a plumber do it now, while polish stocks last. 
 

is freighted food still organic?
======================== 
 
now that event that all of you must have been waiting for - the decision from the soil association as to what actually is organic food. faisal islam is mapping out the dispute behind it ahead of the announcement this week. 

the soil association apparently takes the view that bestowing the label 'organic' is only appropriate to food produced in the uk and which doesn't travel thousands of air miles to these shores. the government doesn't agree, and we're trying to find out what britain's supermarkets think of what would be a significant change to the growing market for organic produce. not great news for african farmers either.

targets have little effect on literacy
=========================== 
 
the beginning tonight of a terrific channel 4 literacy season finds lucy manning in prison - where she meets the over large number of people who end up there unable to read or write. critics claim that teachers are now so focused on getting average pupils to reach a government targets that they're neglecting those who have the greatest difficulty and may be perceived as beyond hope. at what cost?

interview: craig venter
==================== 
 
i've had one of those challenges that leave one wishing one had done science at school. i've had to interview craig venter who appears to be a few weeks away from creating artificial life. actually more specifically an artificial chromosome, it's fascinating stuff but during the interview i sometimes wonder whether my questions were so confused that he couldn't understand them or whether his science was so pure that i couldn't understand it. but the result you will be unsurprised to learn is a spell-bindingly interesting exchange. 
 
see you at seven as ever is, 
 
jon snow.

"hamid karzai interviewed in london
=================================

this is going to brief because i�ve got to rush out and interview president karzai of afghanistan who is in london. in fact you could almost stick a pin in a map and choose your leader because the turkish prime minister and the israeli prime minister are both here too, totally unrelated. 

bomb attack kills 11 civilians in afghanistan
=================================
afghanistan is once again in the news after an american bomb attack killed 11 civilians some 30 km west of the capital. but it�s in the news too because karzai wants to talk to the taliban  (or some of them)  because nato is under pressure all over the place without enough troops to sustain what they�re doing, because the drug dealers are on the march and because of the crisis next door in pakistan. all fertile material for a fascinating interview at 7. 

new diploma introduced, but a-levels to stay 
=================================
here, a-levels are to be preserved  in the educational system for england and wales , at least for the moment, as the government invests in new diplomas in their continuing bid to level the playing field between the academic and the vocational. we shall be talking to the schools secretary   ed balls at 7. 

more tragedy in portugal as parents drown saving their children
==============================================
the scale of the familial tragedy in the algarve continues to grow. two children orphaned, another has lost a mother and his father is dangerously ill in hospital. poor old portuguese police find themselves under pressure from the british media again, given that it�s around the corner from where madeleine mccann disappeared, but in truth the rescue services seems to have behaved in an exemplary manor.

what went wrong in scotland�s may elections?
==================================
the scots learn the scale of the cock-up surrounding their elections  - you may remember that vote counting was hit badly by delays, and a huge number of ballot papers had to be rejected (over 140,000).  
the investigation  concludes that combining scotland's parliamentary and council voting on the same election sheet and same day is a main cause of the rejected papers, and also criticises those responsible for planning the election (a leading figure in that process was douglas alexander, then labour's man at the scottish office). 

britain�s population explosion
======================
britain�s population heads for a major increase over the next thirty years-or-so, faisal islam is on the case.

new defendant in the dock over lesley molseed�s 1975 murder
==============================================
the extraordinary case of the murder of lesley molseed in 1975 is in the courts, with dna responsible for the arrest of the man in the dock. unusually, the judge has already told the jury that he has previous convictions. this is the case in which stephan kisco served 16 years for a crime he most definitely did not commit.

wildfires continue to burn in california
=============================
finally, efforts in california continue to try to marry devastating pictures of wildfires with grieving celebrities who have lost their homes. but as yet, none of them have, and the few humbler people who already have seem to be of less interest to the world�s media. sarah smith has got her fire beating broom in her hand at 7.

1. sign up edri statement on coe recommendation - campaign update
============================================================

31 international and national organisations from different countries have
already signed edri statement on a new recommendation from the
council of europe (coe) failing to uphold freedom of expression in
the online environment.

as other related instruments are currently in preparation by the coe,
edri calls for ngos and groups from all over the world to sign up in
support of edri statement and take further action to help avoid the
risk of more damages to freedom of expression and information in the
online world. signatures should preferably be gathered before 28 october
2007, as the next meeting of the coe expert group having prepared
this recommendation is scheduled on 29-30 october 2007 in strasbourg
and will be attended as an observer by edri representative.

in this statement, edri expresses its serious concerns over this
recommendation that promotes opaque ""self-regulation"" and other soft
law instruments driven by private interests and implemented through
technical mechanisms. edri is deeply concerned that such instruments
will be used to legitimize subtle means of censorship, through
privatised censorship and measures to protect against so-called
harmful content.

as the opennet initiative reports through its internet filtering
study, and as numerous filtering cases reported in edri newsletter
have shown, technical mechanisms are used to remove local content or
block access to it when hosted on foreign websites to censor political and
social content found objectionable by some. even when the content is
allegedly illegal, filtering is seldom, if at all, operated following a
legal order, leading to serious breaches of the rule of law.

in addition to freedom of expression, privacy and access to
information and knowledge are other fundamental rights at stake when
technical filtering mechanisms are promoted and used. given the lack
of transparency of the filtering tools, no one knows what happens to
the personal data of persons tentatively accessing blocked content.
finally, such filters are more and more used on content-sharing
platforms, while they are still showing many design failures,
including some leading to massive over-blocking of legal and
legitimate content.

edri considers thus this recommendation to be damaging and a
retrograde step for freedom of expression and freedom of the press in
the online world, as well as for other fundamental rights and for the
rule of law principle.

2. new italian draft law - to disguise state censorship
============================================================

as it already happened six years ago with the infamous law 62/2001, a new
law draft on the ""re-arrangement of publishing"", prepared by the italian
government on 3 august 2007 and now entering parliament procedure, clearly
intends to enforce bureaucratic and financial burdens, as well as sanctions,
also on the free and private expression of thought by ""normal citizens""
using the internet.

the text prepared by the government is deliberately confusing and ambiguous.
if approved by parliament as it is, it would cause confusion and uncertainty
on the possibility of free expression even for people who are not
professional journalists or publishers of newspapers, magazines or
broadcasting.

there is no explanation of why the government intends to treat as
""card-carrying journalists"" also people who are not, and don't intend to
be and why the proposed text omits any clear statement that the
obligations to be instituted by this law (if it is approved) apply only
to professionals and entrepreneurs in the content producing industry.

if the concern is to sanction ""defamation"" the government's proposal is a
non-solution: the appropriate laws already exist, and anyone publishing
online can be easily identified. so this cannot be an excuse for
liberticide legislation.

the fact is that this legislator draft leads to the creation of one more
""damocles sword"" to be used against whoever publishes ""uncomfortable""
opinions or information. such a law, if approved, would not be obeyed by
many people, for a variety of reasons. because they are not aware of it, or
they don't understand it. because of deliberate and legitimate ""civil
disobedience"". because of its obscure meaning and difficult interpretation.
etc. the result would be the creation of an ""artificial crime"" to be
persecuted according to circumstances and opportunities - or to the whims
and biases of whoever will hold this power.

this is damaging also for business enterprises using the net, as well as
internet providers. this draft law inflicts a severe blow on hosting
services, as well as those based on communities and the free providing of
widely useful content. therefore, in addition to contrasting the universal
right for free speech, it also hampers a business model that has
increasingly proven to be an extended social benefit.

what we demand: it should be clearly stated that the obligations - if they
are really necessary - apply only to publishers, press services and
generally only to information entrepreneurs, that work for profit and obtain
public subsidies, clearly excluding any publishing by private individuals
and non-profit organisations that are not ""selling"" anything.
---------------------------------------------------------
after this statement was issued by alcei on 19 october, and following
widespread protest in italy, the government has been making ""reassuring
noises"" about amending the draft. of course this does not mean that the
problem is solved. it will be necessary to keep an eye on what happens
to this law - if and when it goes through parliamentary process - as
well as on any other government or legislative action that may have
similar effects.

3 . online police searches adopted also in austria
============================================================

austrian authorities have announced that the police will start from 2008 to
use online searches as an investigation tool in order to keep up with the
use of new technologies for terrorist and serious crimes. austria is joining
in this way germany and switzerland that are working in the same direction,
despite serious privacy concerns.

in an interview to the radio station ö1, austrian minister of internal
affairs, günther platte, and the minister of justice, maria berger,
announced this new measure that was proposed to be discussed in the
government meeting. the two politicians explained that the measure will be
used only in connection with terrorist cases or other serious crimes, where
a punishment of at least 10 years imprisonment is foreseen.

the decision adopted by the government meeting on 18 october 2007 still
waits for legal and technical clarifications on how the decision will be
applied and its implementation is not expected to start earlier than late
2008.

the online searches will need a judge's warrant and will be overseen by the
ministry for home affairs' legal protection officer. minister of justice
maria berger said that online searches will only be carried out under
exceptional circumstances and that this measure was needed in order to keep
up with the terrorist's use of the internet resources and as a response to
the growing number of electronic crimes worldwide.

according with the new decision the austrian police will be able to bug the
hard disks of pcs by sending trojan horses to them via the email, but
also planting the trojan horses into the pcs of targeted users after
penetrating into their apartments.

as reported by edri-gram, online searches of computers by the secret
services have been a reality in germany since 2005, following an order of
interior minister otto schily. the german federal supreme court in karlsruhe
ruled, on 5 february 2007, that, according to the german code of criminal
procedure, online police snooping was illegal. since then the german
authorities have shown a higher desire to push for a legal basis of the
online searches of personal computers in germany.

switzerland decided also in june 2007 to allow secret online searches from
federal police authority.

============================================================
4. some internet and media companies push for principles on user content
============================================================

a set of principles desired to create an online environment for the
development of user generated content (ugc) services and the protection of
copyright owner rights has recently been set out by several media and
internet companies such as cbs, dailymotion, fox entertainment group,
myspace, nbc, veoh networks, viacom, at the initiative of walt disney and
microsoft. other major companies such as google or other rights owner (sony,
timewarner, paramount) did not sign the document.

ugc services refer to services such as myspace, soapbox on msn video,
dailymotion and veoh.com, but exclude technologies such as browsers, email,
or search services.

the principles are a set of guidelines which has objectives such as the
""elimination of infringing content on ugc services, the encouragement of
original and authorized user-generated audio and video content uploads, the
protection of the user privacy and the encouragement of a fair use of the
copyrighted content on ugc services"", but also seen by outsiders as an
attempt to bring drm into the online video-sharing space.

although the principles are meant to ""foster innovation and encourage
creativity"" they have in view the use of a state of the art filtering and
blocking technology that may eliminate infringing content from ugc services.
the regular removal of the unblocked infringing content and the links to
sites that are clearly or predominantly used for the dissemination of
infringing content are targeted as well. the companies should also
collaborate in creating procedures to deal with claims of blocking out of
error. the principles mention ""fair use"" four times in the document, but do
not refer to what the signatory organisations understand by this term.

one of the obligations set out by the principles is that of preserving for a
60-day period the connection information related to an internet user having
posted infringing content online, information that the site is suppose to
provide to the rights owner, at request.

another interesting commitment of all the members of the ugc agreement is
that, while observing the rules, they should not attack each other in case
some of the content is not properly filtered; this, in the context that two
of the members, nbc universal and veoh, have applying complaints one against
the other. having signed the agreement might bring a leverage of the
litigation.

the big absent from the signatories of this agreement was google, which, on
15 october, unveiled its filtering technology for youtube video-sharing site
that it owns now. google representatives were part of the negations but have
decided not to sign the agreement for the time being. youtube engineering
director jeremy doig stated: ""(..) industry-wide technology mandates are
generally a bad idea. this industry is still young and we believe that
marketplace innovation can lead to creative solutions we can't even begin to
imagine today.""

a reason for this reserve could be the law suit between google and viacom
over copyrighted content on youtube. one other reason may be the fact that
google's new filtering technology removes the infringing content immediately
from the site while the guidelines suggest ""blocking infringing uploads
before they are made available to the public.""

5. website with p2p download links found legal by spanish court
============================================================

the case against sharemula.com, a website publishing p2p download links
through which users can acquire movies, music and software, has been
recently dismissed by a spanish magistrate.

the case was opened in october 2006, when the brigade of technological
investigations retained 15 people responsible with sharemula.com, asking the
closing down of the site for alleged copyright infringement. at that time,
the spanish media made a big fuss of the case, the 15 retained people having
been considered as belonging to a large international clandestine pirating
network. the case was considered a big success by federación antipiratería
in spain (anti-pirating federation).

a year later, a madrid court decided that the site and its administrators
have not infringed any law as the links to p2p downloads have no commercial
purposes. furthermore, the site included no illegal content but only links
to downloads. the defence of sharemula was based on three previous similar
rulings.

the defence attorneys consider they have found a judge that rigorously
applied the law and dismissed the accusations that were based on sheer
ignorance. they believe the prosecution, including sgae (general society of
authors and editors), egeda (audio-visual producers' rights management
association) and large companies such as microsoft, the walt disney company
iberia, twentieth century fox home etc. will appeal the decision but hope
that the appelate court will back up the present decision.

6. electronic voting machines eliminated in the netherlands
============================================================

all nedap/groenendaal voting machines were decertified on 1 october 2007 by
district court of alkmaar in the netherland, following the 'voting with
confidence' advice issued on 27 september by korthals altes committee
(created with the purpose to verify the validity of the systems), and the
announcement of the secretary for the interior that the 'regulations for
approval of voting machines 1997' would be withdrawn.

the action is the result of an administrative law procedure started by 'we
do not trust voting computers' foundation in march 2007. the foundation had
issued a report in october 2006 that had examined the nedap/groenendaal es3b
in operation in 8 out of the 9 poling stations in the netherlands. the
report was showing that the systems were highly insecure, leaving room for
fraud at a large scale. the korthals altes committee report came to confirm
the results of the foundation.

in their report, 'we do not trust voting computers' showed how the system
worked, what software they had created for it and gave details on how one
could get complete and undetected control of the election results if one had
access to the devices before the elections, even for a brief period. the
report also showed that radio emanations for the systems could be received
at a several meter distance giving the possibility to find out how people
voted.

the next elections in the netherlands will use paper ballots and red pencil,
a method that provides transparency and that is now used in several
countries of europe and in the us where a paper copy of each vote is
required. in ireland, the use of the voting machines is stopped due to
serious questions regarding their security and the uk election council
intends stopping all electronic voting pilot projects that had been carried
on during the last years. in germany doubts have arisen regarding their use
as well. in france, serious problems occurred during the pilot electronic
voting in spring election, the system having been considered a disaster. a
petition for the preservation of the paper voting was issued on that
occasion.

in the future, the next phase in the netherlands after paper poling could be
the use of 'vote printers' and separate counting machines.

7. fingerprints in passports: the german population in a risky experiment
============================================================

on 1 november 2007, registration offices throughout germany will begin
collecting fingerprints from all citizens wishing to travel. two years
after the storage of a facial image on an rfid chip has been introduced,
the project of full biometric registration of the whole population
continues. germany's chaos computer club (ccc) points out once more that the
epassport has risks and side-effects, which particularly affect senior
citizens.

many older people will have problems giving fingerprints. experience as
well as international and german studies show that considerably more
than 10% of all senior citizens must expect to have no recordable
fingerprints. this will inevitably expose them to discrimination through
tightened inspections and longer delays. people working intensely with
their hands will face the same disadvantages.

the ccc advises that only a few days are left in which passports without
fingerprint registration can be applied for in german registration
offices. even people whose passport is still valid can apply for a new
passport, thus evading the german authorities' data collection mania
until the federal constitutional court rules on the compatibility of the
new measures with the german constitution.

even according to the german government, there is no measurable gain in
security through biometric passports. this is proved by the written
answer to a parliamentary question. as ccc speaker dirk engling says, ""the
introduction of this risky technology seems to be motivated mainly by the
commercial interests of a few current and former members of the government -
this should really be a case for the corruptions perceptions index of
transparency international"".

the extent of the threat posed by biometric data on rfid chips is
illustrated by none other than jörg ziercke, president of the federal
criminal office. despite all assurances by his ""experts"" that the
biometric data is ""safe"", he wears his own biometric passport in a
protective cover to shield it against radio waves. the federal foreign
office has also shown its distrust of the security promises of the
interior ministry: german diplomats will receive passports without rfid
chips due to the ""higher threat levels"" they face.

8. update on dna and biometrics in french immigration law
============================================================

with its final vote on 23 october 2007, the french parliament
confirmed the introduction of dna testing in the new immigration law to
prove family links for foreign candidates applying for a more than 3
months visa on family regrouping grounds. the only recourse could now
be a decision from the french constitutional council to remove this
provision from the law, since the parliamentary opposition
(socialists, communists and greens), together with some centrist
members of parliament, announced that it would challenge the adopted
law before the constitutional judge.

the final vote occurred after a parliamentary commission agreed on
the harmonisation of the draft texts resulting from both the national
assembly and the senate. with respect to dna testing provision as
initially adopted by the national assembly, some modifications
occurred in order to answer to some of the criticisms. main changes are:
the dna tests will be paid by the french government and not anymore
made at the expenses of the visa applicant; the biological family
links would be checked against the mother's dna to avoid unexpected,
possibly dramatic revelations in the family; the need for the test
should be authorised by a civil court; informed consent from
concerned persons should be expressly collected; the whole provision
is now declared as experimental, and will be revised after the end of
year 2009.

however, these changes have by no mean satisfied the numerous
opponents of this provision, as their demand remains that dna testing
should not be used to check family links, since such links cannot be
reduced to blood relation. more than 280 000 persons, including
personalities from all political parties, signed a petition, and
thousands of people participated in street demonstrations in many
french cities on 20 october against this provision.

many observers commenting this provision, including in foreign
countries, referred to practices from the nazi occupation period. an
editorial by the new-york times even reminded that 'immigration
issues bring out the worst instincts in politicians', while
republican presidential candidate tom tancredo has recently introduced a
similar bill in u.s. house, as press agencies have reported. french opinion
seem however divided: according to a poll made on 18-19 october 2007, only
45% of the 1000 asked persons find the provision to be ""against french
society values"", while 49% considers dna testing ""as a good measure since it
allows to check if family visa applicants are indeed members of the same
family"".

the french constitutional council will decide upon the challenged law
within one month after the challenge is filed, which is expected to
happen immediately after the vote of 23 october.

in addition to dna testing, the draft law introduced further use of
biometrics against foreigners, without much debate. article 62 of the
adopted law requires that the beneficiaries of financial support
(foreigners voluntarily returning home) have their photograph and
digital fingerprints taken and stored in yet another database. this
provision has been introduced with the claim that it would help
fighting frauds in case these persons come back to stay again in france.

in an analysis published on 24 october french edri member iris
highlights how this provision, in the same way as the dna testing and
former biometric databases set-up, is part of the general strategy
and managerial logic based on the rationalization of processes and
procedures, leading to the fundamental transformation of a conception
of society once based on mutual trust into a situation of generalized
suspicion.

9. ""oscars for data leeches"" - german big brother awards 2007
============================================================

the 2007 ceremony for the german big brother awards called ""oscars for data
leeches"" took place on 12 october in bielefeld when the jury had the
difficult task of choosing from more than 500 nominations.
the negative big brother awards germany, which have started in 2000, are
organised by edri-member, foebud association.

for the category workplace, the winner of this year award was novartis
pharma gmbh company for having spied on its employees. although the company
has joined the ""faircompany initiative"", has committed itself to the
""voluntary self-control for the pharmaceutical industry"" code of conduct and
boasts on its respect for fair work conditions and human rights, at the same
time it sends detectives to follow its sales people to take notes on their
visits to pharmacies and gps. following these ""reports"" the company sends
appraisals to the employees through its hr department.

hamburg municipal education and sports authority won the award for the
regional category for having introduced a central register of pupils for all
pupils and students, which is permanently compared with the register of
residents in order to find children and parents without a residence permit.
the alien registration office has access to these files. due to this
register, parents are taking their children out of school because they risk
to be found and therefore they may be deported. thus, hamburg acts against
the right of access to education which applies to all children with or
without a residence permit.

for the business category, deutsche bahn ag (the german railways plc) was
declared winner. the company has introduced as many measures as possible to
identify its travellers, from personalised online ticket selling, to the
mandatory provision of photo and date of birth for discount passes, video
surveillance and up to a rfid chip for the all-inclusive one-year ticket
without its customers' knowledge and without any guarantees of personal
data protection.

the award for the consumer protection category went to marriott, hyatt and
intercontinental hotel chains in germany for keeping personal information on
their customers from their eating or drinking preferences, to their credit
card data, address, telephone number, hobbies, and even medical type
information. what is the most frightening thing is that the customers have
no idea all their personal information is stored in the hotel computers and
probably in the servers located in the us.

the technology category was won by ptv planung transport verkehr ag, for
their individual rating system of car insurances that uses the
""pay-as-you-drive"" technology. a piece of equipment is used to record the
driving routes and behaviours and then to send the information to the
insurance company.

the award for politics category was received by the federal minister of
finance, for the introduction of a permanent tax id number for all taxable
persons, something like a personal code number which is unconstitutional in
germany. the data is gathered by all the registration authorities in the
country and sent to the federal central tax authority which assigns the
unique tax id and sends the number back to the registration authorities. ""it
would be incompatible with the constitutional value of human dignity if the
state were to assume the power of compulsive registration and cataloguing of
the individual with their complete personality"" is the decision given in
1969 by the federal constitutional court, the highest court in germany.

the federal minister of justice received the award in the communication
category for a bill that goes against the federal constitutional court
ruling of 1983 that states as constitutional the collection of
non-anonymised data for undetermined or not-yet-determined purposes. the
bill of the ministry of justice will introduce the retention of all
telecommunications connection data in germany, in agreement of the european
directive 2006/24/ec according to which member states have to oblige
providers and public communication network operators to retain traffic data.
however this directive comes into conflict with the federal constitutional
court ruling.

the government and administration category was won by monika harms,
germany's federal prosecutor, for the anti-terror measures against opponents
of the g8 summit in may this year, for her decision to collect and preserve
body scent samples from g8 opponents and especially for the postal
surveillance in hamburg in search of letters from militant g8 opponents
which was a clear violation of the privacy of correspondence and of the
professional confidentiality, as stipulated by the german constitution.

besides the individual awards on categories, the jury of the big brother
awards also established the most worrying trend at the moment in germany
which is that of the increase in registration of biometric data, by both
public and private institutions.

an audience award was attributed for the second time at the german big
brother awards and the winner designated by the audience was monika harms
for the anti-terror measures against opponents of the g8 summit.

10. communia: public domain and alternative licensing for knowledge-sharing
============================================================

today's digital networks offer extraordinary new opportunities for
sharing and building upon our global, public pool of knowledge.
shedding light on the scientific, educational, economical, ethical and
political importance of the digital public domain has, therefore,
become crucial for the future of our knowledge-based societies.

this is the rationale behind a freshly launched project: communia, the
european thematic network on the public domain in the digital age.

funded by the european commission under the econtent+ programme and
coordinated by the politecnico di torino's  nexa research center for
internet and society, the three-year long project held its kick-off
meeting in turin, italy, on 28 september 2007.

the project has been proposed by a network of 36 members from 21
countries who are dedicated to developing theoretical analysis and
strategic policy discussion of existing and emerging issues to the
public domain in the digital environment, as well as related topics
including, but not limited to, alternative forms of licensing for
creative material (including the creative commons licenses), open
access to scientific publications and research results, and management
of works with unknown authors (i.e. orphan works).

communia is organizing a productive schedule of thematic workshops and
conferences to be held in several european venues, with the goal of
maintaining a strong link between participants. the network aims at
producing both analytical and practical results, including the
production of a book and an academic journal, a ""best practices"" guide
for european research and reference centres and a final strategic
report containing specific policy guidelines.

the overall goal is to create an open, wide, and active partnership
aimed at improving knowledge access and to help all the stakeholders -
public and private, from the local to the european level - tackling
the issues that the existence of a digital public domain have raised
and will undoubtedly continue to raise.

for more information, please visit the project website; questions,
comments, requests for information and/or clarification should be sent
to the coordinator of communia, prof. juan carlos de martin
, or to communia project manager, andrea glorioso
.

11. social welfare leaks show flaws in irish government databases
============================================================

two recent stories have confirmed that security measures in irish government
databases are inadequate.

in the first case an official in the department of family and social affairs
was found by police to have leaked personal and financial information to his
brother, a serious criminal, which was then used to target victims for
burglary and blackmail. the second case involved another official in the
same department who examined files on irish celebrities and systematically
leaked that information to the media.

both cases appear to reveal a culture in that department where it is ""common
practice"" among department employees to be ""checking people casually"". they
follow another recent scandal where officials in the same department were
found to be selling information to the insurance industry.
